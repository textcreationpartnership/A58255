            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS Humbly Offered, <hi>For not Doubling the Subſidy on</hi> Tobacco <hi>from</hi> Virginia <hi>and</hi> Maryland, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THat the laying ſuch additional Subſidy on Tobacco of 1 d. <hi>per</hi> Pound, above the 5 <hi>d.</hi> already laid by Act of Parliament, will become a great Injury to the Trade of this Kingdom, and to the Plantations of <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Maryland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Becauſe thereby it will be advanced to Forreign Markets, which will gradually bring the Trade of our Plantations out of uſe, by the planting it in <hi>Europe,</hi> it being evident that the affording our Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations Tobacco cheap, is a conſiderable Occaſion and Support of our Trade to <hi>Holland</hi> and the <hi>Baltick Seas,</hi> the great Expence of Tobacco being amongſt the poorer ſort of People. Beſides, 'tis evident, to all that know <hi>Holland</hi> and other parts adjoyning as <hi>Gelderland, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tricb, Hanover, Brabant,</hi> and ſeveral other Parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> plant great Quantity of Tobacco yearly, computed to be of equal Quantity with either of the Provinces of <hi>Virginia</hi> or <hi>Maryland,</hi> and would ſooner enlarge their Planting if made dearer by Law.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Beſides, ſuch Duties may occaſion others in Forreign Parts, to add greater Duty on our Plantation Tobacco, to encourage their own Growth, which hitherto they have not done.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It will occaſion the leſsning the Conſumption by its dearneſs, becauſe the pooreſt ſort of labouring People are the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumers, beſides the debauchery by Stalks, and otherwiſe uſed to make it cheap.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Such great Duty will occaſion great Quantities to be run on Shore, and ſmugled in many Out ports and Creaks of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to the Ruine of thoſe that ſhall pay the Duty, and to the Deſtruction of fair Traders.</p>
            <p n="5">V. It will alſo ſwell the Duty to ſuch a great Summ, that the Traders in it will not be able to advance it, nor will it be worth any Man's doing it, becauſe that the Intereſt of the Money that muſt redeem the Goods, will in Value exceed the Principle of the Goods; ſo that thereby the Plantations will inevitably be diſcouraged.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. And further the Hazards of Debts contracted by Sale of Tobacco, will be ſo great, that no Man will trade in it, when
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:39329:2"/>the Merchants muſt give Credit for eight times the Value of his Principle by Cuſtom, Fraight and Charges, by which means all Merchandize will be diſcouraged.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. It will alſo hereby greatly abate the Navigation to thoſe Plantations, to the Prejudice of this Nation, which employs 200 Sail of Ships at leaſt yearly in it.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. It will alſo abate the Conſumption of the Manufactures of this Kingdom, on which thoſe Plantations have hitherto depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and have in this particular been more uſeful to this Nation than any Plantations of his Kingdom whatever, and that while Laws are making to encourage the Wooling Manufactory, this wholly diſcourages it as to thoſe Plantations.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. It will engage the Planter to leave off planting Tobacco, and fall in to Manufactories, and to plant Cotten-wool, Hemp and Flax, and breed up Sheep for their Cloathing, which hath in ſome meaſure been already attempted, finding that their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in making Tobacco could not cover their Nakedneſs. And being once put upon that thoughtfulneſs, will in a manner diſſolve the Trade in Tobacco, ſo uſeful to our Commerce at home and abroad.</p>
            <p n="10">X. This heavy Duty will wholly take off the Affections of thoſe Plantations from <hi>England,</hi> to ſee themſelves charged twenty times higher in this Duty than any their Neighbouring Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations for their Growth, which is more profitable to them than Tobacco is to <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Maryland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">XI. And its by late Experience found, that the Import of 3 d. <hi>per</hi> Pound, hath ſo affected the Planter, that ſeveral Counties in <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Maryland</hi> have abated the planting Tobacco, and fallen into Manufactories of both Linnen and Woollen, to ſuch a degree, as to give ſome Supply to their Neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Wool which was four or five Years ago uſeleſs to them, is now fought after and bought up for 12 d.<hi>per</hi> Pound.</p>
